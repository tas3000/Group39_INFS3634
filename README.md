STAYFIT

Stayfit is a gamified fitness application prototype which allows users to learn and do exercises based on target areas, as well as watch video tutorials on exercises and do quizzes to test their knowledge on muscles and exercises.
This application has been developed in response to COVID-19 which will assist the UNSW community in maintaining a healthy lifestyle, achieve their fitness goals and learn about exercises and muscles whilst staying in isolation.
The application provides exercises that are short and require no equipment, which means that they can be done at home.

This project is part of a university course (INFS3634) utilising Android Studio.
